                    Waterloo Engineering admits accepted applicants in two rounds; one in late March/early April, and one in mid-/late May.
                    During consideration for admission in the first round, there may not be any grade information for one or more of the
                    required courses due to taking place before midterm marks are released in the second semester where an applicant might
                    happen to be taking the aforementioned required courses. In that case, marks from grade 11 courses may be considered.

                    For all required courses, a minimum grade of <span style="font-weight: bold;">70%</span> is required. However, all Engineering programs require a conditional
                    admission average of <span style="font-weight: bold;">85%</span> in order for an offer of admission to remain valid at the end of the academic year.

                    This slot is instead replaced with another 4U or 4M elective course. Additionally, the minimum grade for ENG4U is <span style="font-weight: bold;">75%</span>

                    <p class="aif__info-para">Generally, taking any of the required courses outside of regular day school and/or repeating required courses significantly reduces your admission prospects, unless there are extenuating circumstances explained in your AIF.

If that doesn’t sound serious, let's just say it has the same impact as dropping 30% in one of your courses. Not surprisingly, it is strongly recommended to take your required courses in day school in one attempt, if possible. The 5% cut can be reduced or mitigated only upon explanation of extenuating circumstances in the appropriate section of the AIF.

However, schools that offer these kinds of courses can demonstrate how hard you work in your academics and your ability to succeed with university-level content, and you can make a note of those on the AIF if you so desire. Taking these kinds of courses has been noted to help decrease your adjustment factor by a slight amount to boost your admissions score, however, so all is not lost. You can also mention these on your AIF.</li>

                    <p class="aif__info-para">As you'd probably expect, the minimum requirements probably aren’t enough to cut it for how competitive Waterloo Engineering is. So we ask the age-old question: “What average should I have to be admitted into my program?”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Waterloo Engineering doesn’t have cutoffs for admission consideration, but nevertheless, a higher average is going to correspond to a higher admission chance. However, not all Waterloo Engineering programs were created equal, meaning some of the programs are more competitive and generally require better averages to be admitted in order to stand out from the rest. For more competitive programs, individual selection is used to better decide which applicants stand out more; this is where the AIF has a greater impact.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Competitive averages are listed below, you should be aiming for these averages to get into these programs, but remember that having these averages doesn’t necessarily guarantee that you’ll be admitted; always push yourself to attain the best grades possible and impress evaluators on your AIF and interview.

                    The following are charts of admission chances based on academic averages only, one for Canadian applicants, and one for visa applicants. Data is from fall 2019 applicants, so the data varies from the above information. Again, visa applicants tend to have a disadvantage compared to Canadian applicants.

                    <h3 class="aif__info-header" id="grades__overall">Grades vs. AIF vs. Interview vs. Adjustment Factor</h3>
                    <p class="aif__info-para">As you know, grades aren’t the only part of the admissions process; the AIF, video interview, and adjustment factor are the other things that complete your applicant profile, but they’re not weighted equally.</p>
                    <h3 class="aif__info-header" id="grades__oa__grades">Academic average</h3>
                    <p class="aif__info-para">As stated before, your academic average is the most important factor when it comes to your admission decision, and is the equally weighted mean average of your top 6 courses (including required courses).</p>
                    <h3 class="aif__info-header" id="grades__oa__aif">Admission Information Form</h3>
                    <p class="aif__info-para">The AIF is next. The Admission Information Form is an opportunity to share about yourself, your achievements, your goals, extenuating circumstances, and more. The AIF is mandatory for engineering programs and not submitting it will deny your admission outright unless you have a really good reason that is appealed to them. The AIF is graded out of 5 points, and is added to your score. Most average AIFs are given a 3. The minimum score is 0.3 if incomplete and 0.5 if complete. Higher scores are given for exceptional AIFs due to excellence as well as participating in contests and events offered by UWaterloo. For more details, check out <a href="./aif" class="aif__info-link">the page on AIF tips and tricks.</a></p>
                    <h3 class="aif__info-header" id="grades__oa__int">Video interview</h3>
                    <p class="aif__info-para">The video interview is another element of your admission profile, and is also marked out of 5. Average submissions normally end up netting a 3. Although optional, you basically forfeit potentially 5 points that can be added to your total applicant score, and for more competitive programs, it’s basically required to have a ghost of a chance, unless you have a 100% average, and even then, I’m not too sure. Plus, everyone else is doing it, and you lose nothing by going for it, ergo, you’re at a huge loss if you decide not to submit an interview. An explanation of the video interview process, as well as how to prepare for it, can be found <a href="./interview" class="aif__info-link">here</a>.</p>
                    <h3 class="aif__info-header" id="grades__oa__adj">Adjustment factor</h3>
                    <p class="aif__info-para">The last factor affecting your admission chances is the adjustment factor. It’s something you have no control over, make of it what you will. You might have come across the term “adjustment factor” a couple times throughout this website, the official UWaterloo website, or elsewhere. What is it? Although not something explicitly given on the official UWaterloo website, the adjustment factor is a number that is given to some Ontario schools based on how well engineering applicants from those schools do in their first year at Waterloo Engineering, basically telling you how large the gap is between their grade 12 averages and first year averages. The lower, the better. UWaterloo likes to be secretive about this information, so you won’t find this information on their website.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p class="aif__info-para">The adjustment factor for your school (or 16, for the 90% of high schools that don’t have one) is subtracted from your admission score. This can mean good news for people from schools with low adjustment factors, like those coming from Québec’s CÉGEP system with a 5% adjustment factor, but don’t panic if that’s not true for you, you can definitely get into your desired program if you work hard enough and put in the effort you need into your academics, AIF, and interview. Regardless, it can still present a significant advantage or disadvantage, as adjustment factors can range from around 10 to 30, a huge margin that can give people with the same academic averages massively different chances of being admitted. For example, someone with an adjustment factor of 11 has a 5% advantage over someone with the default adjustment factor of 16. <strong>A list of adjustment factors for Ontario high schools, accurate to 2020, can be found <a target="_new" href="Freedom_of_Information_Request_2020.pdf" class="aif__info-link">here</a>.</strong></p>
                    <h3 class="aif__info-header" id="grades__oa__calc">Calculating your overall admission score</h3>
                    <p class="aif__info-para">Your final admissions score is calculated by adding the average of your top 6 courses (out of 100), AIF score (out of
                    5), and interview score (out of 5), and subtracting your adjustment factor. Say you have a 90% average, you think you
                    did ok on both the AIF and interview, netting a 3 on both, and your school’s adjustment factor is 13. Your
                    total admission score would be 90 + 3 + 3 - 13 = 83. Keep all of this in mind when choosing what to prioritize spend more time on during the admissions process.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I hope that after all this information you'll know what you'll need to be able to apply and get into the Waterloo Engineering program of your choice, and how to carry that out. All the best, and we hope to see you at the University of Waterloo soon!
